##Summary 

AI project for predicting the cost of cottage construction.

## Cottage Construction Price Estimator

The project uses machine learning to estimate the cost of constructing a cottage. The model will use various features such as location, number of floors, size, materials and schedule to provide an accurate estimate of the total cost of construction.

## Background

Building a cottage is a significant investment, and cost estimation is an important aspect of the planning process. Predicting the cost of construction accurately can be challenging due to various factors such as harsh competition between construction companies and labor costs. It is also challenging for inexperienced builders to estimate the cost of construction accurately, which can result in project delays and cost overruns. An AI-powered cost estimation model can provide accurate, transparent, objective and reliable cost estimates based on various factors, ensuring that builders can budget effectively.

## How is it used?

The project can be used by all parties involved in the cottage building process including builders, contractors, and homeowners. They can input various features such as location, size, materials, and construction type into the model, which will then provide an estimate of the total cost of construction. This information can be used to plan and budget effectively, ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget. It should also be easily understandable and shareable between all parties.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data sources for the model will include various factors that affect the cost of cottage construction such as location, size, materials, schedule and labor costs. The aim is to partner with various construction companies or alternatively companies that already provide technical solutions to construction companies.

## Challenges

The project's accuracy will depend on the quality and quantity of data used to train it, which can be challenging to collect and maintain. The project will also need to account for changes in material and labor costs, which can vary over time and location. More unique and architecturally ambitious construction projects should probably be excluded due to their rare construction techniques that might not fit the model.

## What next?

The project can be expanded to calculate estimations for bigger and more varied construction projects like residential houses, apartment complexes and so on. Other factors can also be added overtime to make the model more accurate like energy efficiency requirements that are changing constantly. Additional collaborations with real estate agents, contractors, and material suppliers can provide a more comprehensive and accurate dataset for the model.
